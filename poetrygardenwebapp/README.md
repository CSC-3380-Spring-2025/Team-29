## Dependencies
- List all dependencies here
- Don't forget to include versions
### Downloading Dependencies
Describe where to download the dependencies here. Some will likely require a web download. Provide links here. For IDE extensions, make sure your project works with the free version of them, and detail which IDE(s) these are available in. 

## Commands
Describe how the commands and process to launch the project on the main branch in such a way that anyone working on the project knows how to check the affects of any code they add.

```sh
Example terminal command syntax
```

It is very common in these sections to see code in peculiar boxes to help them stand out. Check the markdown section of the Project Specifications to see how to add more / customize these.

```python
def code_highlight_example(m: int, m: float, s: str) -> str:
	return s + str(n*m)
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

```c#
static void Main(){
	Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
